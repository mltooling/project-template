# Contribute to Project Template

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our project. This page will give you a quick overview of how things are organized and most importantly, how to get involved.

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the projects as well.

## Issues and bug reports

- We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests. Submit issues for any [feature request and enhancement](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=02_feature-request.md&title=), [bugs](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=01_bug-report.md&title=), or [documentation](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=03_documentation.md&title=) problems.
- First, do a quick search on the Github issue tracker or the known issues section in the readme to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue rather than creating a new one. Old - and sometimes closed - issues also often include helpful tips and solutions to common problems.
- When creating an issue, try using one of our [issue templates](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/issues/new/choose) which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently. If no template applies, you can of course also create an issue from scratch.
- Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors should use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the project maintainers.
- Please apply one or more applicable [labels](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/labels) to your issue so that all community members are able to cluster the issues better.
- If you have questions about one of the existing issues, please comment on them, and one of the maintainers will clarify.

## Contributing to the code base

You are welcome to contribute code in order to fix a bug, to implement a new feature, to propose new documentation, or just to fix a typo. Check out [good first issue](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [help wanted](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/labels/help%20wanted) issues if you want to find open issues to implement.

- Before writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or issues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction (üëç - upvote, üëé - downvote). If you are unsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.
- Should you wish to work on an existing issue that has not yet been claimed, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on and begin work (the maintainers will assign it to your GitHub user as soon as they can). This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.
- To contribute changes, always branch from the `main` branch and after implementing the changes create a pull request as described [below](#opening-a-pull-request).
- Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). Also, make sure to follow the commit message guidelines.
- Test your changes as thoroughly as possible before you commit them. Preferably, automate your test by unit/integration tests.

### Development Instructions

To simplify the process of building this project from scratch, we provide build-scripts that run all necessary steps (build, test, and release) within a containerized environment by using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run all actions locally.

#### Requirements

- [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Build

Execute this command in the project root folder to compile, assemble, and package all project components:

```bash
act -s BUILD_ARGS="--make" -j build
```

You can also run the build only for a specific (sub-)component by providing the path to the component folder, as shown below:

```bash
act -s BUILD_ARGS="--make" -s WORKING_DIRECTORY="./docs" -j build
```

#### Test

Once all the project artifacts are build, you can execute this command in the project root folder to run the integration & unit tests and style & linting checks for all components:

```bash
act -s BUILD_ARGS="--make --test" -j build
```

The `--make --test` steps are configured as default. If you call the job without `BUILD_ARGS`, so you can also just run:

```bash
act -j build
```

#### Release

To release a new version and publish all relevant artifacts to respective registries (e.g. Docker image to DockerHub), you need to first create a git version tag based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard and, subsequently, run the release job:

```bash
git tag vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH && act -j release
```

### Commit messages guidelines

Commit messages should be as standardized as possible within the repository. A few best practices:

1. Always use simple present (imperative mood) to describe what the commit does. Explain what & why, not how!
2. Start with a capital letter.
3. Don‚Äôt end the subject line with a period.
4. Descriptive but short subject line (< 50 chars).
5. Link to issues by mentioning them in commit messages.
6. Examples:¬†`Add image to documentation section 3`,¬†`Fix memory leak. Closes #3`,¬†`Split method X into two methods`. Refer to¬†[this blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)¬†for more information about good commit messages.

### Opening a pull request

1. **Set title**. The title should follow our [commit message guidelines](#commit-messages-guidelines) (example: `Fix memory leak in picture loader`). If the pull request closes a specific issue, the title can be used to mention the issue (example: `Fix memory leak in picture loader. Closes #3`). Prefix the title with `[WIP]` *(Work In Progress)*¬†to indicate that you are not done but need clarification or an explicit review before you can continue your work item.
2. **Add appropriate labels** (e.g. bug, enhancement, documentation).
3. **Set description:** Describe what the pull request is about and add some bullet points describing what‚Äôs changed and why (make use of the provided template). Link the pull request to all relevant issues in the pull request description (e.g. `Closes #10`). Find more information on linking pull requests to issues¬†[here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). Add `BREAKING CHANGE` into the description in case the PR introduces breaking changes.
4. Open the pull request and make sure existing tests and checks pass. The PR will only be merged into `main` if it is consistent with style and linting guidelines.
  
### Review & merging of a pull request

1. Every pull request will be reviewed by at least 1 reviewer and will also trigger CI pipelines to automatically build and test the changes. If your PR is not getting reviewed for a longer time, you can @-reply a reviewer in the pull request or comment.
2. Every comment on PR should be accepted as a change request and should be discussed. When something is optional, it should be noted in the comment. If a review requires you to make additional changes, please test the changes again. Create a comment on the PR to notify the reviewers that your amendments are ready for another round of review.
3. Once the pull request is approved by at least 1 reviewer, the pull request can be merged. `Squash & merge` is the preferred merging strategy.
4. In case a new (feature) branch was created in the main repository, please delete this branch after a successful merge.

### Git Workflow & Versioning

- We use [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/university/training/gitlab_flow.html#release-branch) as our branching workflow.
- Feature branching: Use (short-lived) feature branches. Naming schema:  `feature/<DESCRIPTION>`, if related to one specific issue use suffix: `feature/<DESCRIPTION>/<ISSUE-NUMBER>`.
- For versioning, we have adapted the¬†[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard. All version tags on Git must be prefixed with `v` (e.g.`v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`). The version can be suffixed with a tag that indicates a pre-release or unfinished version. All our local development builds will use the following dev suffix: `-dev.<BRANCH>`.

## Code conventions

### Python conventions

- Code Style: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Documentation Style: [Google Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
- Naming Conventions: [naming-convention-guides](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python#python-naming-convention)
- Build Tool: [setuptool](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)
- Code Formatter: [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- Import Sorting: [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
- Linting: [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)
- Type Checking: [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- Testing: [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/)
- Use type hints wherever possible: [Cheatsheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)
- Minimum compatibility: Python 3.6

#### Code style & naming

- **Code style** should loosely follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- **Documentation style** should follow the [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
- **Naming** should follow the recommendations [here](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python#python-naming-convention).

#### Code formatting

We use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for code formatting and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting. The following commands run `black` and `isort` on all Python files of the component (when executed in the component root):

```bash
python -m isort --profile black .
python -m black .
```

If you want to only check if the formatting and sorting is applied correctly to all files, execute:

```bash
# formatting check:
python -m black --check .
# import sorting check:
python -m isort --profile black --check-only .
```

You can also configure `black` and `isort` inside your code editor. For example, if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), you can add the following to your `settings.json` for formatting and auto-format your files on save:

```json
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.sortImports.args": [
        "--multi-line=3",
        "--trailing-comma",
        "--force-grid-wrap=0",
        "--use-parentheses",
        "--line-width=88"
    ],
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.python",
        "editor.formatOnPaste": false,
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### Code linting

We use [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) for linting, and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for type checking. You can find our flake8 configuration inside the `setup.cfg` or [here](.github/linters/.flake8). The following commands run `flake8` and `mypy` on all python files of the compontent (when executed in the compontent root):

```bash
# type checks
python -m mypy .
# linting
python -m flake8 .
```

You can also configure `flake8` and `mypy` inside your code editor. For example, if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), you can add the following to your `settings.json` for linting and type checking:

```json
{
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.lintOnSave": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.flake8Args": [
        "--ignore=E203,E501,W503"
    ]
}
```

#### Adding & running tests

We use the [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) framework for testing. For more info on this, see the [pytest documentation](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html). Tests for modules and classes live in their own directories of the same name inside the `tests` folder. To be discovered, all test files and test functions need to be prefixed with `test_`. To run the test suite, execute:

```bash
# run test suite:
python -m pytest .
```

When adding tests, make sure to use descriptive names, keep the code short and concise and only test for one behavior at a time. Try to `parametrize` test cases wherever possible and avoid unnecessary imports. Extensive tests that take a long time should be marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`.

### Java conventions

- Code Style: [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) ([Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle) to enforce styling)
- Documentation Style: [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.6-comments) (Javadoc)
- Naming Conventions: [naming-conventions-guide](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/java)
- Build Tool: [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- Code Formatter: [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
- Linting: [sonarlint](https://www.sonarlint.org/)
- Testing: [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- Logging: [SLF4J](https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j) with [LOG4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j)
- Minimum compatibility: Java 11

#### Code style & naming

- **Code & documentation style** should loosely follow [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
- **Naming** should follow the recommendations [here](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/java).
- To enforce the Google Java Style, we recommend to run the [checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle) tool with the `google_checks.xml` configuration. For VS Code, you can use the [checkstyle extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle).

#### Code formatting

We use [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) for code formatting and import sorting. The following command run `google-java-format` on a Java file:

```bash
google-java-format --replace path/to/file.java
```

If you want to only check if the formatting and sorting is applied correctly to all files, execute:

```bash
google-java-format --dry-run --set-exit-if-changed path/to/file.java
```

You can also configure `google-java-format` inside your code editor. For IntelliJ you can find information [here](https://github.com/google/google-java-format#intellij-android-studio-and-other-jetbrains-ides) and for VS Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mngrm3a.vscode-google-java-formatter).

#### Code linting

We recommend to use [Sonarlint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) for linting in Java. You can configure Sonarlint for VS Code as explained [here](https://www.sonarlint.org/visualstudio) or for IntelliJ as described [here](https://www.sonarlint.org/intellij).

#### Adding & running tests

We use the [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) framework for testing. For more info on this, see the [junit documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/). Tests for classes live in their own directories of the same name inside the `src/test` folder. To be discovered, all test classes need to be suffixed with `Test`. To run the test suite via maven, execute the following command in the component root:

```bash
# run test suite:
mvn verify
```

### React conventions

- Code Style: [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Documentation Style: [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html)
- Build Tool: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (+ [babel](https://babeljs.io/))
- Package Manager: [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Code Formatter: [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Linting: [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) (javascript) & [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) (css)
- Testing: [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- Minimum compatibility: Node 12

#### Code style & naming

- **Code style** should follow [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- **Documentation style** should follow the [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html) convention, though overall we advocate self-explanatory code over comments.
- **Custom Guidelines:**
  - Components should be written as [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of the old class-style wherever possible.
  - Functions should in general be written in the [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) notation. Arrow functions should be defined outside of the `render` function to avoid [any performance problems](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html#arrow-function-in-render).

#### Code formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting. The following command run `prettier` on a JavaScript file:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/prettier --config .prettierrc --write <path/to/file>
```

Our default configuration for prettier can be found in [.prettierrc](.github/linting/.prettierrc). The configurations adhere to [Airbnb's JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

You can also configure `prettier` inside your code editor. For VS Code you can find information [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

#### Code linting

[ESlint](https://eslint.org) is used for linting JavaScript code with the linting rules defined in the [.eslintrc.js](.github/linting/eslintrc.js) file. You can configure eslint for VS Code via [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

For CSS linting, [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) is used for which the configuration can be found in the [.stylelintrc.json](.github/linting/.stylelintrc.json) file. Styleint can be configured in VS Code via [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint).

The following commands run `eslint` and `stylelint` on all files to show linting issues (when executed in the component root):

```bash
# Run eslint on all javascript files:
./node_modules/.bin/eslint "**/*.js"
# Run stylelint on all css files:
./node_modules/.bin/stylelint "**/*.css"
```

#### Adding & running tests

_TBD_
